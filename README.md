# PingPong-CSharp-Console
Created this console app game by using OOP in C# lenguage.
Its a arcade mode of the clasic PingPong game,
you can adjust the goal limit, field size,
speed of the game, and difficulty to test
your gaming skills.

The desing is ASCII like, whose style match perfect
with this og game.

Im currently thinking to do an update adding competitive mode,
with a leaderborad where users can see their time to beat
and the points they got in that run.

Im open to any suggestions.
Opensource code so you can use it to learn, fix o upgrade it!

Make sure to give me credits! :D
